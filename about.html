    <h1>About this guy</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Marcus Lazaro, and I am a trying boy in this large world we live in.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1999, I was born into the Filipino family of the Lazaro's who immigrated to America from the Philippines during the 80s. My mom tried naming me Magellan, but my dad, named Ferdinand, found the convention too cheesy. 90% of the people I talk to everyday call me Marcus, but most of my older family knows me as Magellan. In life I've grown fond of my hobbies related to games, drawing and technology. Correlating to these hobbies, I've built my own PC to my liking for games and bits of game development and other things. I present myself online as a digital artist and as an avid gamer to the point my manager from my old job at Starbucks messages me to get some sleep for work the next day rather than playing games.

        Regarding my college life, I started 2 years ago not sure of what I wanted to study immediately after high school. In fear of falling behind a transfer degree to a university, I attended business classes for the sake of satisfying my parents constant questions regarding my life. In truth, I'm not entirely sure what I want in my life even now. The past few months have been filled with regret for answering my parent's questions before my very own in life. While I may be falling slower than most peers my own age, I've learned that I need to value my own interests rather than anyone else's. I'm planning on finishing this degree by the end of the Winter Quarter, and hopefully by then I'll finally decide what's best for me. Right now I can say I'm enjoying what I'm learning a lot more than what the business classes has offered. Web-design seems to be present amongst book authors and other artists, and seeing how they live their day-to-day lives has inspired me to take the same route.
