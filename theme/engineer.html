        <!--General Info-->
        <p class="trait center">Location of origin: Bee Cave, Texas, USA</p>
        <p>Job: Area Denial</p>
        <p>Motto: "I like to make things"</p>
        <p id="description">The Engineer is a soft-spoken, amiable Texan with an interest in all mechanical things. He
            specializes in constructing and maintaining Buildings that provide support to his team, rather than fighting
            at the front lines, making him the most suitable for defense. The Engineer's various gadgets include the
            Sentry Gun, an automated turret that fires at any enemy in range, the Dispenser, a device that restores the
            health and ammunition of nearby teammates, and Teleporters that quickly transport players from point A to
            point B.
        </p>
        <p>Because the Engineer's ingenious devices are under constant threat from explosives and devious enemy Spies, a
            good Engineer must keep his gear under a watchful eye and under repair with his Wrench at all times. When
            the Engineer needs to get his hands dirty, his trio of generic yet capable weapons, along with the
            assistance of his helpful hardware, make him more than capable of holding his own in a fight. If need be,
            the Engineer can even pick up and haul constructed buildings to redeploy them in more favorable locations.
            While usually viewed as a defensive class, the Engineer has a selection of high-tech weapons that allow him
            to destroy projectiles or to build faster-deploying, less damaging Sentry Guns, which give him great utility
            at the front lines too. His Teleporters are also a key point to both the offensive and defensive team's
            success, allowing slower, heavier classes to reach the front-lines quicker.
