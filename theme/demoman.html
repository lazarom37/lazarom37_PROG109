    <main id=block01> <!--General Info-->
        <p class="trait center">Location of origin: Ullapool, Scotland, United Kingdom</p>
        <p>Job: House Cleaning</p>
        <p>Motto: "Boom Boom Baby"</p>
        <p id="description">A fierce temper, a fascination with all things explosive, and a terrible plan to kill the Loch Ness Monster cost the six year old Demoman his original set of adoptive parents. Later, at the Crypt Grammar School for Orphans near Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands, the boy's bomb-making skills improved dramatically. His disposition and total number of intact eyeballs, however, did not.
            <br>
            <br>
            Word of his proficiency with explosives spread, and it was not long before Crypt Grammar received two visitors; the Demoman's real parents, who lovingly explained that all Demomen are abandoned at birth until their skills manifest themselves, a long-standing, cruel, and wholly unnecessary tradition among the Highland Demolition Men. His unhappy childhood had ended, but his training had just begun.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p>The Demoman is a scrumpy-swilling demolitions expert from the Scottish town of Ullapool, and is one of the most versatile members of the team. A master of explosives, the Demoman strategically deals massive amounts of indirect and mid-range splash damage. Armed with his Grenade Launcher and Stickybomb Launcher, the Demoman uses his one good eye and the knowledge of his surrounding environment for well-timed sticky bomb detonations that send enemies skyward, often in many pieces. Should anyone get past his explosive ordinance, however, they will be shocked to learn the Demoman is extremely proficient at melee combat, being one of the deadliest melee users in the game, with a variety of powerful melee unlocks in his arsenal.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Demoman excels at swift destruction; he can bounce his grenades at creative angles to wreak havoc on enemy Sentry Gun emplacements while remaining safely out of sight. His sticky bombs are a perfect tool for area denial, and are effective at keeping opponents away from any carts, control points, or Intelligence that he deems off-limits.</p>

        <ul class=tf2prof>
            <li>During startup, it is best advised to set up your stickies to catch incoming enemies off-guard in certain areas</li>
            <li>Demoman has another set of weapons that play far off from what he is intended to do. See the Demoknight video below</li>
            <li>You can charge your Stickybomb Launcher to launch farther</li>
