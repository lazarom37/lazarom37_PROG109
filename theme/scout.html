        <img src="images/scoutLine.png" class="middle" alt="his actual name is boston :o)">
        <p id="trait center">Location of origin: Boston Masachusetts, USA</p>
        <p>Job: Rapid Recovery</p>
        <p>Special Ability: Double jump</p>
        <p id="description">The youngest of eight boys from the south side of Boston, the Scout learned early how to solve problems with his fists. With seven older brothers on his side, fights tended to end before the runt of the litter could maneuver into punching distance, so the Scout trained himself to run. He ran everywhere, all the time, until he could beat his pack of mad dog siblings to the fray</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, the Scout is a fast-running scrapper with a baseball bat and a snarky "in-your-face" attitude. He is the fastest and most mobile mercenary on the battlefield unassisted. His Double Jump leaves slower opponents such as the Heavy struggling to keep up and helps him navigate the terrain while dodging oncoming bullets and projectiles. Carrying a Scattergun, a Pistol, and a Bat, the Scout is an ideal class for aggressive fighting and flanking. The Scout is a great class for quick "hit-and-run" tactics that can either sap away enemies' health or kill them outright due to his ability to get in, do damage, and dash away before even being noticed. However, the Scout is tied with the Engineer, Sniper, and Spy for having the lowest health of any class, leaving him vulnerable when he is on the front line; a fair trade-off for his ability to run in and out of a contested hot-spot very quickly, letting him lead the team to victory without the other team even noticing in time.</p>

        <h1 class=tf2build>Strategy and Tips</h1>
        <ul class=tf2prof>
            <li>With Scout's speed, you can essentially choose your battles. Don't be careless and fight one you know you can't win, just run away to safety</li>
            <li>Given Scout's low health-pool, it is also unwise to run around Heavies and Sentry Guns built by Engineers</li>
            <li>Mix up your opponent by jumping and strafing left-and-right. Your speed makes you a hard target</li>
            <li>Getting closer to your enemies means more damage, but don't get too close when it's a pack</li>
            <li>Leave teleporters to your teammates, you will most likely catch up with them by the time they arrive at the exit</li>
